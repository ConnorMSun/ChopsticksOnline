          Chopsticks is a short and sweet game where two players are given a set of 'hands' 
          with a value of one, then take turns adding a hand's to another of the three hands. 
          If a hand ever reaches a value above 4, a value of 5 is subtracted from that hand. 
          To win, you must get your opponent to have both of their hands at value 0!
